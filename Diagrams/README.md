# diagrams

In this folder, the pinout diagram of the circuit of the underwater glider is provided with specific diagrams for each electronic component used.
Three stepper were used with sizing of NEMA17, A4988 circuits were used (3 of them, one for each motor).
four hand-made leakage sensors were used in the two endings and the center of the glider. Moreover, limit switches were used to prevent the mechanical part from stepping out of their limits mechanically, two were used for each motor. 
As stated before, the beaglebone blue was used as the main controller, an therefore, its pinout diagram is provided.

Two power systems were used in the glider, one is 12V for the motors and the beaglebone. And 5V system for sensors and to provide power in the case of power outage in the 12V system.
The batteries used in addition to the charging circuits are shown in diagrams too.
