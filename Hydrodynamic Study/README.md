#Hyrdrodynamic_Study

In order to simulate the motion of an underwater glider, the hydrodynamuc coefficients should be calculated. 
These coefficients include the drag (CD), lift (CL), and side force(CSF) coefficients in addition to the hydrodynamic momentum coefficients around the three
axes(CM1, CM2, CM3).
The hydrodynamic coefficients depend on the shape of the outer surface of the vehicle and are variable with the angle of attack and the side slip angle.
In this part of the project, the formula of the 6 coefficients were estimated for the designed underwater glider. 
Ansys Fluent was used to caclulate the coefficients with diffrent values of the attack and side slip angles. 
Matlab was then used to fit the formulas and visulaize the results.
