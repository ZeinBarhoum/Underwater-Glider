# Modeling and Simulation

A modeling of the designed underwater glider was conducted, the mathmatical equations that formulate the motion of the vehicle depending on the 
input on the motor were analyzed and inputed into Matlab and Simulink to simulate the motion of the underwater glider under diffrent inputs.

The full model and simulation files are provided here.

Note: the Initialize.m file compute the symbolic inverse of multiple matrices in the model in order to avoid run-time calculations of matrix-inverse 
this dramatically decreases the time of the simulation.
