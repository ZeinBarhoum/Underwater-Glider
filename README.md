# Underwater-Glider

This repository include the design and source code files for the project Underwater Glider

Underwater gliders are underwater vehicles that donâ€™t use any external propellers or thrusters.  

These vehicles are autonomous, and their motion depends on controlling the buoyancy-gravity force and the placement of the center of gravity.

Buoyancy is controlled using buoyancy engine (BE) which could operate in one of two ways:
  1-	Varying the mass of the vehicle by inhaling or exhaling the surrounding fluid (water).
  2-	Varying the volume of the vehicle by inflating or deflating an external balloon-shaped bladder
  
The BE used in this project is from the first type and a tank is designed using syringes to accomplish this functionality.

To control the center of gravity, a moving mass (MM) system was designed.

The Design folder include all design files for the underwater glider contructed in this project.
