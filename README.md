# Underwater-Glider

This repository includes the design and source code files for the project "Underwater Glider"

Underwater gliders are underwater vehicles that donâ€™t use any external propellers or thrusters.  

These vehicles are autonomous, and their motion depends on controlling the buoyancy-gravity force balance and the placement of the center of gravity.

Buoyancy is controlled using buoyancy engine (BE) which could operate in one of two ways:
  1-	Varying the mass of the vehicle by inhaling or exhaling the surrounding fluid (water).
  2-	Varying the volume of the vehicle by inflating or deflating an external balloon-shaped bladder
  
The BE used in this project is from the first type, and a tank is designed using syringes to accomplish this functionality.

To control the center of gravity, a moving mass (MM) system was designed which can change the center of gravity along the main axis by sliding the mass, and to change the center of gravity on the YZ plane, rotating the mass was the method of choice.

A full study and implementation were conducted in this project starting from designing, modeling and simulating and ending with manifacturing, testing and controling the underwater glider.

All the files are included in the repository and for further information please contact the authors of this project.
